Evan Flaks and Jackson Hanson Machine Learning Project
Abstract:
This project aims to predict the final scores of Power 5 NCAA Division I college football games using only data available before each game, such as offensive/defensive efficiency, average points scored/allowed, and other team-level statistics. This dataset is from before college football’s conference realignment, so Power 5 is defined as Big 12, Big 10, SEC, ACC, and Pac 12. The approach involves training regression models on historical data from 2002 through January 2025. To evaluate model performance, we will compare predicted versus actual game scores using metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), focusing on how well the model forecasts real outcomes before games are played.
Motivation and Question:
As college athletes, we were motivated by the opportunity to explore how well machine learning models can forecast actual game outcomes using only pre-game data. Kaggle has given us access to a comprehensive dataset of NCAA Division I college football team statistics from 2002 through January 2025. Accurate score predictions could help fans, analysts, coaches, and sportsbooks make more informed decisions. Our central question is: How accurately can we predict the final scores of college football games using team-level metrics that would have been available before the game was played? This involves estimating both teams’ performance for each matchup and exploring which features (e.g., offensive yards, scoring averages, defensive rankings) are most predictive of final outcomes. This could shed some light on which aspects of football coaches should be focusing on the most in order to increase their production and lead to more wins.
Planned Deliverables:
The final deliverable will be a complete Python package containing all code for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. We will also document a jupyter notebook, outlining our process and methods throughout the project. This Jupyeter notebook will show all data cleaning, model training, evaluation, and visualization to show what conclusions we can draw. It will be in the same style as Blog Posts we have completed earlier in Machine Learning.
The final predictions can be stored in a pandas dataframe and exported to a csv file. The columns will be: game ID, team_1, team_2, team_1_predicted_score, team_2_predicted_score. Although the games will not be played until next fall, we can also add columns for team_1 and team_2’s actual score, allowing us to easily manipulate the data frame to calculate error rates and how successful our project was.
A caveat to our project is that we will not be able to measure success until next semester, because games will not be played until the fall. In a scenario of full success, the deliverable will accurately predict final game scores for future matchups using only pre-game team-level data, demonstrating strong predictive power and helping inform decision-making or game simulations. In a case of partial success, the project will still yield a robust and reusable machine learning pipeline that highlights which team statistics are most predictive of scoring outcomes—even if score predictions aren’t highly accurate. This would still provide valuable insights for analysts, fans, and future model refinement.
In order to evaluate the model’s success right now, we can take out a year (ex. 2024) and use all the games from this year as the Test data to evaluate our model on. We will need to be careful not to overfit when conducting the analysis within the dataset because if the data doesn’t generalize to next fall’s season, our performance won’t be very good.
Another creative way to measure success would be to compare our score predictions to the lines set by bookmakers. For example, if for the Texas v Ohio St. game we predict Texas 24 OSU 21, we can look at the odds Draft Kings set for this game. If DK predicted Texas as a three point favorite, that would mean that our algorithm is pretty good because we set the same line as the professional handicappers at DraftKings.

Resources Required:
To complete this project, the primary resource required is a comprehensive dataset of NCAA Division I college football team statistics. I will be using the following Kaggle dataset, which contains detailed game-by-game team statistics from 2002 through January 2025: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cviaxmiwnptr/college-football-team-stats-2002-to-january-2024?resource=download
What We Will Learn:
We would both like to learn version control using GitHub. Both of us have extensive Math and CS experience, but we have never completed a live coding project with a repository that is housed on GitHub.
Jackson would like to expand his regression toolbox more. We have just started learning regression in Machine Learning, so this knowledge will deepen as the semester progresses, but Jackson is looking forward to getting introduced to new models such as Neural Networks, kNN, and Support Vector Machines. He is also excited to really customize this model based on what makes college football his favorite one to watch on TV. Creating new features like whether or not a game is a rivalry game, how many five-star recruits a team has on their roster, or the time the game is played will be cool to mess with.
Evan is excited about the feature engineering that will likely be necessary. Throughout the semester, we have mostly used “nice” datasets with predictive features. Evan is interested in taking some of the stats from the data set and applying some transformations to possibly create stronger predictive features. He is also excited to get hands-on experience with regression models and learn how to assess their performance using real-world metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Evan is also excited about working as a team because we will strengthen our project management skills, dividing tasks effectively and maintaining clear communication throughout the development process.
Risk Statement:
One potential risk is that the historical features used to represent team strength—such as points per game or total yardage—may not be strong predictors of future game outcomes due to variability between seasons, such as changes in coaching staff, player turnover, or schedule difficulty. If these patterns do not generalize well to unseen games (especially preseason predictions), the model’s performance could suffer. Another risk is that the landscape of college football changes every single season. New styles of offense and defense are created on a regular basis, so a feature that is good at predicting a team’s output in 2002 will not be a good predictor in 2024. For example, in 2002, Ohio St. won the national championship while throwing for a measly 152 pass yards per game. This year, the same team won the championship throwing for 263 yards per game. A third risk is the lack of detailed player-level data or updated information for the upcoming 2025 season. Since the model relies on estimating 2025 team strength using past team-level stats, missing variables like key injuries, quarterback changes, or recruiting class impacts could limit the predictive accuracy and make it difficult to confidently forecast early-season games.
Ethics Statement:
This project aims to provide accurate score predictions for NCAA Division I college football games using only pre-game team-level data. The main groups who could benefit include sports analysts, researchers, fans, and data science practitioners who are interested in better understanding team performance and predictive modeling in sports. These users can gain valuable insights into game dynamics and improve their analytical capabilities. However, there is also potential for unintended negative consequences. One concern is the ethical risk surrounding the misuse of this model for sports gambling. While the project is not intended for betting purposes, the availability of score predictions may encourage or facilitate gambling activity. This could unintentionally contribute to problem gambling behaviors or exploitation by individuals or platforms that misuse predictive tools for profit. Additionally, if the model performs poorly due to biases in historical data or lack of up-to-date team information, it could mislead users who rely on it for decision-making. We assume that (1) most users will interact with this model from an educational or analytical standpoint, and (2) predictive models, when responsibly presented with appropriate disclaimers, can be a force for better understanding rather than exploitation. To promote responsible use, the project will include clear documentation about its limitations and intended purpose. We will only be interacting with sports betting metrics like spreads to gauge how effective our model is. We are not encouraging sports betting in any way.
